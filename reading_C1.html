            title: "The Paradox of Choice in the Modern Era",
            text: "In the contemporary world, the sheer abundance of options is often perceived as a hallmark of freedom and personal autonomy. From the myriad of products on supermarket shelves to the endless stream of content on digital platforms, we are led to believe that more choice inevitably leads to greater satisfaction. However, psychological research suggests a counterintuitive phenomenon known as the 'paradox of choice'. When faced with an overwhelming array of alternatives, individuals often experience cognitive paralysis rather than liberation. The mental effort required to evaluate every possibility leads to decision fatigue and, frequently, a nagging sense of regret after the choice is made. We find ourselves constantly wondering if another option would have been superior, leading to a decrease in overall well-being. Furthermore, the pressure to make the 'perfect' choice in an era of infinite information places an immense psychological burden on the individual. To navigate this, society must shift its focus from maximizing choice to enhancing the quality of the decision-making process itself.",

                { q: "What is the primary argument of the text?", a: ["Freedom is defined by the number of choices we have.", "An excess of options can negatively affect mental well-being.", "Supermarkets should reduce the number of products they sell."], correct: 1 },

                { q: "According to the text, why does regret occur after a decision?", a: ["Because the product was actually bad.", "Because people fear they missed a better alternative.", "Because the decision was made too quickly."], correct: 1 },

            title: "Urbanization and the Loss of Biodiversity",
            text: "As the global population increasingly migrates to urban centers, the expansion of concrete jungles continues to encroach upon natural habitats at an unprecedented rate. Urbanization is not merely a shift in human geography; it is a profound ecological transformation that often results in the fragmentation of ecosystems. When a forest is bisected by a highway or replaced by a residential complex, the indigenous flora and fauna are forced into smaller, isolated pockets of land. This isolation restricts gene flow among species, making them more vulnerable to disease and environmental shifts. While some 'generalist' species, such as pigeons and rats, thrive in urban environments, 'specialist' species that require specific conditions often face local extinction. However, the rise of 'green urbanism' offers a glimmer of hope. By integrating vertical gardens, wildlife corridors, and urban parks into city planning, we can mitigate some of the damage. The goal is to transform cities from ecological deserts into hybrid environments where biodiversity can coexist with human infrastructure. Success in this endeavor requires a radical reimagining of what a city should be—not a fortress against nature, but a part of it.",

                { q: "What is the difference between 'generalist' and 'specialist' species?", a: ["Generalists are larger than specialists.", "Generalists adapt easily to cities; specialists do not.", "Specialists are more common in urban areas."], correct: 1 },
                { q: "What does 'green urbanism' propose?", a: ["Moving people back to the countryside.", "Integrating nature into city design.", "Painting all buildings green."], correct: 1 },
                { q: "The word 'encroach' in the text implies:", a: ["To protect carefully.", "To gradually intrude on territory.", "To move away from."], correct: 1 },

                { q: "What is a 'wildlife corridor' likely intended to do?", a: ["To trap animals in cities.", "To allow animals to move between habitat fragments.", "To provide a place for tourists to see nature."], correct: 1 },
